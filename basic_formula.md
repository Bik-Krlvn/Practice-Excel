# Basic Formula in excel

## Sum

```console
 =SUM(TargetCellStart : TargetCellEnd)

```
## Average

```


## NB
Make use of the fill handles, by dragging over
to target cell, which will apply the formulars
respectively

1. E 	xponents (x) ^ 2
1. M 	ultiplication *
1. D	ivision /
1. A	addition +

If your calculation is not correct, click the fumular
tab and select evaluate formula to see what order excel
is using to make the results


## CELL References
> there are two types of references in excel
* Relative
* Absolute

## Relative Refrence
> Is when you copy a cell value/ formula to another cell.
> it moves the rows/columns and apply formular/values to the
> target.

## Absolute Reference
> Is actually making a reference cell constant.
> To make a cell constant you add a '$' before cell letter
and before the cell number. apply a shorcut with F4 to get
a constant
> example
```console
  $A$1

```
